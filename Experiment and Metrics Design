1) The key measure of success number of trips between the two cities that are reimbursed. This is the behavior we want to incentivize. By offering toll reimursements we can calculate the number of trips between the two cities and how many different drivers are going between the two cities.

2) a) I would randomly assign each partner driver into a group. Group 1 would receive toll reimbursement while Group 2 would not receive toll reimbursement.
b) I would perform a permutation test. To do this, I assume all the drivers in both groups are from the same distribrution. In this case, we are assuming that offering toll reimbursements have no effect on changing their driving patterns. This is the null hypothesis. We can then evaluate the permutation test,  determine the p-value, and see if there is a statistically significant difference in the two groups.
c) After conducting the experiment and permutation test, we can make a recommendation to the city. If there was not a significant difference between the two groups, then we need to brainstorm other incentives the city can provide to incentivize drivers going back and forth between the two cities. If there was a significant difference between the two groups, we can recommend that the city try reimbursing tolls for all drivers.
